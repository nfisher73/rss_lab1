Yet if hope has flown away
Thus much let me avow--
O God! can I not grasp
Is all that we see or seem
O God! can I not grasp
And, in parting from you now,
One from the pitiless wave?
Thus much let me avow--
O God! can I not grasp
And, in parting from you now,
In a vision, or in none,
Through my fingers to the deep,
In a night, or in a day,
All that we see or seem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
While I weep--while I weep!
Them with a tighter clasp?
Them with a tighter clasp?
Is but a dream within a dream.
You are not wrong, who deem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
