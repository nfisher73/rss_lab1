Grains of the golden sand--
In a vision, or in none,
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
Grains of the golden sand--
That my days have been a dream;
In a vision, or in none,
Yet if hope has flown away
While I weep--while I weep!
Is all that we see or seem
You are not wrong, who deem
I stand amid the roar
Through my fingers to the deep,
All that we see or seem
O God! can I not grasp
Take this kiss upon the brow!
O God! can I not grasp
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is all that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
