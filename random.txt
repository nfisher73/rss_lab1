O God! can I not grasp
And I hold within my hand
I stand amid the roar

I stand amid the roar
And, in parting from you now,
O God! can I not save
Is it therefore the less gone?
One from the pitiless wave?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
In a vision, or in none,
Yet if hope has flown away
Is it therefore the less gone?
