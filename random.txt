Grains of the golden sand--
In a night, or in a day,
Through my fingers to the deep,
Is but a dream within a dream.
Through my fingers to the deep,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Of a surf-tormented shore,
I stand amid the roar
Is all that we see or seem
In a night, or in a day,
Through my fingers to the deep,
Through my fingers to the deep,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And, in parting from you now,
How few! yet how they creep
Take this kiss upon the brow!

And, in parting from you now,
That my days have been a dream;
O God! can I not grasp
How few! yet how they creep

O God! can I not save
Yet if hope has flown away
Is it therefore the less gone?
Thus much let me avow--
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
O God! can I not save
Is it therefore the less gone?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Thus much let me avow--
Is it therefore the less gone?
That my days have been a dream;
Grains of the golden sand--
Grains of the golden sand--
And I hold within my hand
Them with a tighter clasp?
